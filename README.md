# SimplestView

SimplestView splits up views and templates in a Rails 3 application to make it easier to improve the code quality therein.
This happens by replacing the anonymous class that inherits from ActionView::Base with your own view class.
This view class becomes the context within your existing rails templates.

_CAVEAT EMPTOR: Works with rails 3, but lacking specs._

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'simplest_view'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install simplest_view

## Usage

1. Inside of your `ApplicationController` or a specific controller: `include SimplestView`
2. `mv app/views app/templates`
3. mkdir app/views
4. append `app/views` to the Rails `autoload_paths` inside of `application.rb`

Inside of app/views, create directories for each of your controllers. Within each controller directory, create a view to match the actions in your controller.

For a controller named PostsController with actions :index, :show, :edit you would create app/views/posts/index_view.rb, app/views/posts/show_view.rb, app/views/posts/edit_view.rb respectively.

Then, create your view by inheriting from ActionView::Base:

```
class IndexView < ActionView::Base
end
```

Any methods defined within will be accessible from your matching templates at app/templates/posts/index.html.erb, etc.

_NOTE: If you do not create a view class, the default rails behavior will continue to work as always!_

## TODO

1. figure out how to test the integration with rails
2. generate to move new template generation into app/templates, and to generate view clases as needed.
